# Learning Polymer

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Custom elements, custom tags. Shadow DOM for encapsulation. Events. Data. Etc.

<https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/first-element/intro>

## From scratch

```bash
npm install -g polymer-cli
git clone https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polymer-3-first-element.git
cd polymer-3-first-element
yarn # or npm install
polymer serve --open
# localhost:8081
```

## Starting by testing out this repo

Using [`yarn`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-yarn): (triple-click to select all)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/learning-polymer.git && cd learning-polymer && yarn && polymer serve --open;
```

And if you don't already have the `polymer` CLI command installed:

```bash
npm install -g polymer-cli
```

(`yarn global add polymer-cli` didn't seem to work for me.)
